The data from Dataset1-8 represent the experimental results of NeuralTE's hyperparameter tuning across different datasets. It is important to note that the test set's class distribution is highly imbalanced across different datasets, resulting in instances where statistical performance metrics report support=0, except for Dataset1 and Dataset2. In the paper, evaluations of all tools were recalculated after excluding categories with support=0. However, in this context, such categories were not excluded from testing, leading to lower reported results in datasets other than Dataset1 and Dataset2 compared to those presented in the paper.
